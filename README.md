This repository contains most of the files from the CS 5614 Assignment 4. This includes docker compose files to run Jupyter Lab and Kafka workers among other local hosts within the Docker container. There are also folders with the data to be used by the kafka producer. producer.scala is a scala version of the producer.py file in the original reposititory for Assignment 4 (which is NOT included here). 

Note: Some of the files are erroneous and not related to this project, but were included to maintain the ability to run the Docker container and access the corresponding local hosts.
